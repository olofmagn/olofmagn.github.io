Understanding the vast landscape of IDS rules—and deploying them effectively within a CI/CD pipeline — can be quite challenging. To tackle this, I’ve been working on a home automation setup that attempts to streamline this kind of process. It handles everything from fetching datasets and rules for potential environments, to building Ansible-compatible rulesets and efficiently distributing new or updated rules across all systems.

The primary challenge I've faced is inconsistent rule validation, which allows for invalid rules to enter the pipeline and cause build failures. To address this, some custom logic is needed to proper validate that the rules fetched from open-source threat sources are compatible and won't break when fully dispatched.

Though this approach works effectively, it comes with significant drawbacks: it's resource-intensive and demands ongoing development maintenance. Before commiting to a custom solution, it is worth evaluating existing alternatives that include these capabilities out of the box. However, I'm documenting the design and methodology I've created to assist others who may need to build custom IDS solutions and face similiar implementation challenges.



One platform I'm currently exploring in more detail is Stamus NDR. I'm evaluating their community version to better understand its CI/CD capabilities and overall value as a Network Detection and Response (NDR) solution.

More on this in upcoming posts.
