Recon is a important first step in any pentest—but it can easily become messy, repetitive, and disorganized. `auto-recon` is a simple tool I built together with my friend Zagros to automate the reconnaissance phase, helping you stay efficient and focused on what really matters: finding real vulnerabilities without getting bogged down in excessive recon work.

Instead of juggling random scripts or losing track of outputs, auto-recon gives you a consistent and organized way to collect information about your target. It handles scope labeling, colors the output for better readability, and keeps everything tidy—making it easier to escalate findings later on.
